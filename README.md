# 🧠 TurboWarp AI Models by [Nigel-Sal]

Welcome to my collection of custom AI models built for **TurboWarp**!  
These models are made for anyone who wants to experiment with AI logic, memory systems, and text processing inside Scratch projects using the TurboWarp mod.

## 📦 What’s Inside

- **AI Models** — my custom-built AI systems for use in TurboWarp. Each `.sb3` file here is a standalone AI project built to test different ideas, features, and logic systems.

## 📖 Model Name Legend

Here’s how to read the names of my AI models:

- `M#` — **Model Number**  
  (Example: `M8`, `M15`)  
  This represents which Scratch AI base system the project is built from.

- `V#.#` — **Model Iteration Number**  
  (Example: `V0.1`, `V0.4`)  
  This represents how many versions or revisions that specific model has gone through on Turbowarp.

**Example:**  
`M15-V0.4.sb3` = Model 15, iteration 0.4 of that AI system.

**Note:**  
The older `VB#.#` naming was only used in the past for a memory reset situation and won’t be used again, since the system has been stabilized.

## 📥 How to Use

1. Go to the **[TurboWarp Editor](https://turbowarp.org/editor)**.
2. Download any `.sb3` model file from this repository.
3. In the TurboWarp editor, click **File > Load from your computer** and select the model you downloaded.
4. Run the project and check out how the AI works.
